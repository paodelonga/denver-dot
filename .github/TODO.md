### sublime-text

- [ ] add escape keybinding to exit from the extended next/prev view
  The objective is to develop a contextual escape sequence, specifically tailored for the
  extended view of a tab or file. Upon activating this sequence, the mode should revert to
  the single-file view from which the extended view was called.
